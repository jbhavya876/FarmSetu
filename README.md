## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React 19, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Vite
- **Blockchain**: Algorand (TestNet ready)
- **Wallet**: Pera Wallet
- **Smart Contracts**: TypeScript (AlgoKit ready)

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy Smart Contract** to get APP_ID
```bash
algokit project build
algokit project deploy testnet
```

2. **Update contractService.ts** with APP_ID
```typescript
const APP_ID = <YOUR_DEPLOYED_APP_ID>;
```

3. **Enable Full Contract Operations**
   - Contract creation and acceptance
   - Price updates and settlement
   - Transaction monitoring

## Development Notes

- **Wallet Integration**: Uses `@perawallet/connect` SDK
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error states and user feedback
- **Loading States**: Smooth UX with loading indicators
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript coverage
- **Responsive**: Mobile-first design approach
- Enable contract creation/acceptance
- Add transaction monitoring
